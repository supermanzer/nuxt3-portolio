# Nuxt 3 Portfolio 

This is a basic attempt to build a portfolio site using Nuxt 3.  

## Getting Started
I am beginning this [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6b2yZZNG6Y)

- Current video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh357OVNSlo)

### Modifications
- I installed and am using the Vuetfify visual frameworks using [these steps](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/#manual-setup)
- I am making modifications to bring my portfolio closer to my earlier portfolio [here](https://supermanzer.github.io)

## Blockers
- I am having issues with GraphQL Nuxt modules
    - Apollo introduced _a lot_ of package vulnerabilities that I was not able to fix and didn't feel comfortable with
    - nuxt-graphql-client seems to have issues with SSR apps
    - Until I resolve this, I will use markdown files to highlight my projects although I was looking forward to the discipline using GraphQL would force on me for cleaning up my existing GH repos.
