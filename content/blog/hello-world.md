# Hello World

This is my first blog post about Things! and also stuff

## Tech Used

I'm using Nuxt3 and Nuxt Content to create this site.  I'm using the Server-Side Rendering (SSR) approach.

```python
def is_cool():
    # Lets  you know this is pretty cool
    return True
```

## Header Highlighting

It appears that headings of level 2 and down are linked/highlighted like anchor links. This is rather odd and I'll try to undo this


## Content Components
