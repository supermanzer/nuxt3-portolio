## Why I started
In my recent professional experience, I have been exposed to working in Golang and Java/Kotlin so my exposure to static typed languages has been growing.  I have realized there are some use cases where this approach makes sense and I figured there were things I could learn.  So I looked around and settled on learning the programming language Rust.

## Why Rust
I had struggled with the official docs for Golang and Java has been around so long, it wasn't easy to find a canonical source that was also current (and I mostly develop in Android using Kotlin anyway).  I started my programming journey with Python. I fell in love with the ease of Python but equally important was the fun and excitement that was implicit in the docs I read.  I have found that the canonical Rust programming [book][def1] has a similar approach.  Learning new things is/should be fun and I don't want to waste my free time trying to force myself through documentation that makes learning a chore.

## Learning in public
I like to learn in public by making my notes and thoughts available to anyone online.  It might ever only be for me but it's a practice I'm trying to maintain and get better at.

I have created a Github [repo][def2] for myself to take notes while I work through the Rust Programming [book][def1].  I didn't realize at first that the `cargo` command to create a new project automatically creates a Git repo as well.  Because of this, some of the projects in this repo are not accessible.  I'm still working on resolving this but it's a low priority.
