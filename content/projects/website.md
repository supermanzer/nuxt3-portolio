## Goal
My intent with this website is to get a better sense of building a website to convery information (my thoughts, essentailly).  However, I am also using this as an opportunity to lear to build a website experience that I find appealing.  

## Approach
I am reprising an earlier version of this site that was built uisng Nuxt2 and deployed on Github pages.  Now I am using Nuxt3 and deploying on Netlify.  I am leveraging Vuetify for a material design aesthetic and Nuxt Content for most of the text content.  I haven't taken a deep dive into Nuxt server-side functions...yet.  I'm sure I'll get there though.  My habit is to learn enough to achieve what I'm looking for.  However, I have also found that when I take the time to learn more of the capabilities of the tehcnologies I am using, I think of new features that I didn't know I wanted to build.
