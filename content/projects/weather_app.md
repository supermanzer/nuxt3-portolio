## Goal
My intent with this project was to develop my Android programming skills while builidng an app that I think we are all familiar with and use regularly.  This kind of app also involves learning a number of useful paradigms in Android programming, such as
* On-device database usage - for storing saved locations
* API querying - Converting location names into Lat, Lon and getting forecast data
* Device permissions - For using tghe approximate device location to localize the default forecast

## Implementation
I decided to use the classic Views based architecture to keep the new topics to a minimum.
